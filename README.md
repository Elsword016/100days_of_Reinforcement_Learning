### Learning Reinforcement learning in 100 days

Following the UCLxDeepmind course by David Silver as the main study material. [[Lecture Videos]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfHX2hHRMVQ&list=PLqYmG7hTraZDM-OYHWgPebj2MfCFzFObQ&index=2&ab_channel=GoogleDeepMind)

| day 1  | Coded a simple Markov Process  <br> Completed: Lecture 1                                                                                                                                                        |
| :----- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| day 2  | Coded the simple student MRP and directly solved Bellman Equation to get v(s) <br> Coded the simple student MDP with a simple Policy to get v(s) <br> Completed: Lecture 2 (till Bellman's Expectation function) |
| day 3       |  Finding the Optimal Policy by implementing Value Iteration, an algorithm that repeatedly applies the Bellman Optimality Equation until it converges <br> Coded the simple student MDP from the slides <br> Completed: Lecture 2  |                                                                                                                                                                                                              
| day 4        | Implemented the grid world from the slides and evaluated a given policy (the "Prediction" problem) and then used it in a loop with a policy improvement step to find the optimal policy (the "Control" problem). <br> Completed Lecture 3 till slide 13 |
